The project was to work with openfoodfacts dataset to provide healthy informations for an app development projects.

My work was dedicated to evaluate product characteristics (fat, salt, sugar and carbon footprint) and help consumer to choose healthy & green product. In October 2020, only 7k/930k products had carbon footprint information, now Yuka and openfoodfacts add 250k products with Eco-score.

It's great to see impolementations of my idea in a real dataset. It provides consumers important informations about environmental choice in food shopping.
